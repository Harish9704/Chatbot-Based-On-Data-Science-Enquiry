  - text: "Hey! I am a Data science assistant bot,how may i help you?"

  utter_data_science :
  - text : "Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics,
   artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden
    in an organizations data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning."

  utter_prerequisites :
  - text : "You'll typically need a degree in a computer science, mathematical or science-based subject to work as a data scientist.
   The following degree subjects may be particularly useful: 
  computer science. data science/computer and data science."

  utter_education :
  - text : "Aspiring students also need to have at least a total aggregate of 50% on their high school score sheet. 
  The data science course eligibility for students looking for opportunities for Diploma in Data Science includes a
   BE/BTech/MCA/MSc degree, with their core subjects being statistics, computer, or programming."

  utter_programming_languages :
  - text : "Top data science programming languages are :<br>
  Python : Python is a general-purpose programming language that can get used to develop any software.
   It is among the top programming languages for data science. 
  Python is known for its simple syntax, easy readability, and code portability. <br>
  R : R is a statistical programming language commonly used for statistical analysis, 
  data visualization, and other forms of data manipulation. R has become increasingly
   popular among data scientists because of its ease of use and flexibility in handling 
   complex analyses on large datasets. <br>
  SQL : SQL is one of the world's most widely used programming languages. 
  It is a declarative language for interacting with 
  databases and allows you to create queries to extract information from your data sets. <br>
  JavaScript : JavaScript is a programming language used to develop web applications and websites.
 It has since become the most popular language for building client-side applications online.<br>
 Java : Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
  and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible"

  utter_skills :
  - text : "1. Programming
Programming languages, such as Python or R, are necessary for data scientists to sort,
 analyze, and manage large amounts of data (commonly referred to as “big data”).
 2. Statistics and probability
In order to write high-quality machine learning models and algorithms,
 data scientists need to learn statistics and probability.
-->Probability distributions
-->Over and undersampling
-->Bayesian and frequentist statistics
-->Dimension reduction
3. Data visualization
Not only do you need to know how to analyze, organize, and categorize data,
 but you’ll also want to build your skills in data visualization. "
